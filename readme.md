# User Dashboard

A responsive admin dashboard built with **pure HTML and CSS**, inspired by **Osama Elzero Template 4**.

This project was developed from scratch to practice real frontend fundamentals without relying on any UI libraries or JavaScript.
All components are styled manually, and the layout is fully responsive using a **mobile-first approach**.

## ✅ Custom CSS Framework

A separate `framework.css` file was created to reuse utility classes, including:
